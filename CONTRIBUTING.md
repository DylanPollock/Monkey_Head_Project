## Contribution Guidelines
To maintain the quality and consistency of the project, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Coding Standards:**
  - Follow Python PEP8 standards for coding.
  - Ensure your code is well-documented and includes comments where necessary.
  - When working with Docker, Kubernetes, or Debian-related optimizations, ensure your configurations follow the project standards for containerization and cloud scaling.

- **Commit Messages:**
  - Write clear, concise, and descriptive commit messages.
  - Use imperative mood in the subject line (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").

- **Testing:**
  - Ensure your code has accompanying tests.
  - Run existing tests to verify that your changes do not break any functionality.
  - For hardware-related code contributions, make sure to follow lab testing protocols and provide benchmark results.

- **Documentation:**
  - Update documentation as necessary to reflect your changes.
  - Ensure that new features or changes are documented in the relevant sections.
  - The core focus of the documentation is to 'breathe new life into old tech,' so make sure all contributions align with this ethos.
